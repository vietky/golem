- initially, there are maximum 5 players allowed, but the game should support up to 4 players. Please fix the player limit to allow up to 5 players.
- initially, there are 6 merchant cards, but only 5 are shown on the UI. The 6th merchant is not visible or accessible to the player.
- initially, 1st player has 3 yellow coins, 2nd and 3rd player have 3 yellow coins each, 4th and 5th player have 3 yellow coins and 1 green coin each.
- server should randomly set the order of players at the start of the game, but currently it always sets the same order. Make sure that the UI reflects the correct player order as determined by the server.
- the copper and silver coins are not positioned correctly on the UI, making it difficult for players to identify and use them effectively.
- I couldn't take any actions from the ui (play/acquire/claim/rest). Please check backend and frontend integration.
- The UI for upgrade actions is not functioning correctly and it's not centered. Players are unable to perform upgrade actions as intended.
- the timer doesn't work
- the rest button doesn't show on player section when it's that player's turn
- player section couldn't scroll horizontally when there are many players
- mobile layout is broken in all sections
- all sections should be aligned centered
